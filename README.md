This is a simple web app built with Next.js (using the App Router) that allows users to upload a CSV file to perform sentiment analysis. The application processes messages from the file, sends them to a Hugging Face API, and displays a dashboard with consolidated results.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **CSV Upload:** Interface to select and upload `.csv` files.
-   **Column Validation:** Checks if the CSV contains the required columns (`username` and `message`).
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses the `tabularisai/multilingual-sentiment-analysis` model from Hugging Face to analyze each message.
-   **Results Dashboard:** Displays consolidated metrics:
    -   Most frequent sentiment.
    -   Worst identified sentiment (based on the confidence score).
    -   Overall Satisfaction Index.
-   **Privacy Policy Page:** A static page with information about data handling.
